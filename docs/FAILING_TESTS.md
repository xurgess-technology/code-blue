# Failing tests on main

**Read this before running the test suites.** These failures were already on `main` when they were
written down, so seeing them does not mean your change broke something. If you fix one, delete its
section here (and its entry in docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md, if it has one) in the same commit.

Last checked: 2026-09-17, `main` at `ded2d46`. The failures reproduce identically on `58d088a`, the
commit before that day's merge. Everything else passes: every headless test scene, three playtest
shifts (`--god --seed=1..3`) and all 19 multiplayer scenarios in `tools/nettest_run.gd`.

How to run things is at the bottom of this file.

## 1. doortest: the paramedics don't push the OR doors open for the gurney

- **Command:** `godot --headless --path . --fixed-fps 60 tools/doortest.tscn`
- **Result:** `FAIL (1 of 82 checks)`, the check `the crew pushed the OR's doors open to bring the gurney through`
- **The check:** `tools/doortest.gd`, around line 361. While the paramedic crew is right in the OR
  doorway (`|lp.z| < 0.9`, `|lp.x| < 0.8` in the door's frame), the OR door's `amount` must go past
  0.7 at some point before the patient is on the table. It never does.
- **The patient still arrives.** The crew gets through, so a shift isn't broken; the doors just
  don't visibly swing for them. Whether the crew clips through a closed door or the door opens too
  late for the check to see it hasn't been established.
- **Where to look:** how the crew pushes manual doors (the loop's crew movement and the door scripts
  in `scripts/doors/`), and `scripts/player.gd` from commit `4b7a431` ("Operator rooted at the
  table"), which changed how the crew and the operating player push each other. That commit is the
  most recent change near this behaviour, but it hasn't been confirmed as the cause.

## 2. mapcheck: a morgue tray out of reach on seeds 38 and 112

- **Command:** `godot --headless --path . -s tools/mapcheck.gd`
- **Result:** exit 1, with
  - `seed 38: 1 containers / anchors out of reach, e.g. anchor 92 (tray, morgue) at (134.9, 0.96, 29.8), nav 3.35 m away`
  - `seed 112: 1 containers / anchors out of reach, e.g. anchor 38 (tray, morgue) at (31.7, 0.96, 59.1), nav 2.60 m away`
- **Effect:** one morgue tray on those seeds can't be reached by the bot's navigation, so loot or
  supplies on it may be unreachable in that shift.
- **Already noted** in docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md (search for "morgue tray"): seed 112 has been reported
  before, and seed 149 has too; seed 38 is new as of 2026-09-17.
- **Where to look:** morgue furnishing in `scripts/level/room_furnish.gd` (where tray anchors are
  placed against walls or equipment) versus the navmesh bake around them.

## 3. The laser surge plays no sound (`dev_zap_01`)

- **Not a test failure**, but it logs a warning during windowed runs:
  `Audio: no cue named 'dev_zap_01' (run node tools/gen_audio.mjs).`
- **Cause:** `scripts/scan_fx.gd` line 262 calls `_sfx("dev_zap_01", -10.0)`. The Audio autoload
  registers numbered files as one cue without the number (`dev_zap_01.wav` and `dev_zap_02.wav` are
  the cue `dev_zap`, picked at random), the way `scripts/dev/dev_room.gd` line 522 already uses it.
- **Likely fix:** call `_sfx("dev_zap", -10.0)`. The WAV files exist; nothing needs regenerating.

## Running the tests

The Godot binary is `C:\Users\ZachBurgess\Desktop\Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64.exe\Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64_console.exe`
(the `.exe` in that path is a folder). From Git Bash, run from the project root.

- Import first after pulling or adding assets: `godot --headless --path . --import`
- **Always add `--fixed-fps 60`** to headless test scenes (about 12x faster).
- **Run headless tests one at a time per checkout.** Parallel runs in the same directory segfault.
- Test scenes, each prints `result=PASS` or `FAIL` at the end: `tools/*test.tscn` (braintest,
  carrycamtest, combattest, controlstest, databasetest, devtest, dissectiontest, doortest,
  downedtest, fogtest, inventorytest, looptest, orscreentest, pockettest, settingstest) and
  `tools/monster_lab.tscn`
- A bot plays a whole shift: `tools/playtest.tscn -- --god --seed=N`
- Map validation: `godot --headless --path . -s tools/mapcheck.gd`
- Multiplayer, every scenario as real processes: `godot --headless --path . --script tools/nettest_run.gd`
  (`-- --only=wall,surgery` for a few)
- Windowed screenshot tools write to `tools/game_shots/` and friends: `menushot`, `faxshot`,
  `tipshot`, `database_shot` (`-- --wall`, `-- --wall2`), `gameshot`, `bootsshot` (rocket boots)
